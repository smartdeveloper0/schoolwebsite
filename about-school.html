    <p>"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." William Butler Yeats

Sawami Vivekanda International High School is the very name that endeavours to light up the ‘fire’ in 1600 dewy eyed souls. Since 2025, with countless little steps, it has bloomed into an institution of brilliance, nurturing its colourful flowers from LKG to Senior Secondary level, to understand, contribute to, and succeed in a rapidly changing society, and thus make the world a better and more just place. It is a co-educational, English medium school under the CBSE pattern and syllabi and is relatively a new link in the nationwide chain of more than seven hundred educational institutions under the direct management of Sawami Vivekanda School Managing Committee, New Delhi. The magnificent building of the school stands in Bikna, far from the madding crowd of the city. <br><br>
